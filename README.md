BDD workshop
==

## Set up

`npm install`

## Run unit tests

`npm run unit`

## Run integration tests

`npm test`

## Instructions

The purpose for today's exercise is to build and test a product for our client.

The methodologies that we are going to use BDD (Behavioural Driven Development)

You will first create user stories in a Gherkin format (i.e. GIVEN, WHEN,AND, THEN) which will serve as the acceptance criteria for the client and drive the cucumber test cases.

The project is divided in:

- `app.js` where the production code is
- `test/*` where the integration tests (BDD) are
- `app.test.js` where additional unit tests reside (TDD) if needed


Try to know the client needs. ASK the client.

Once you know what they are, write a feature (gherkin).

Developers now can implement each step and come back and talk to PM if a rewrite is needed.

Focus on providing business value in the features

## Constraints

- Every team has to have at least 1 Product Manager and 1 Engineer

The objective of this exercise is to focus on improving communication between the clients wants and our delivered product
